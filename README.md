Analog Devices Photometric Device Drivers 
-----------------------------------------

This repository hosts the ADPD family of device drivers.

You will find examples for each family of device. The examples cover not only using the device drivers, but cases where the device driver is not used.

We will be adding additional examples in the coming weeks.

As a first step we suggest you view the License file.
