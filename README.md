-----------------------------------------
In order to get started we suggest following steps:

1. There is extensive documentation including Doxygen present in the "Documentation" directory.

2. The Software License Agreement (SLA) can be found in the "License" directory. 

3. The driver source and the header files are present in the "ADPD Drivers" directory.

4. By default, the driver works for I2C based devices. Uncomment line number 159 in AdpdDrv.h to define ADPD_SPI macro for SPI based devices.

5. The example codes for ADPD103/105/107/108 can be found in the "Examples" directory.
